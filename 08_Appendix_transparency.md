📂 Appendix E — Methodological Omissions & Transparency

🔧 Unexecuted Components:
	•	Oscilloscope data: Admitted absence of hardware-level analog signal validation.
	•	Experimental build validation: No lab rig. No physical instantiation. Yet.
	•	Third-party replication: Not attempted. No external lab confirmations.

🧾 Declarative Integrity:
	•	“Model is falsifiable”: This phrase is not decorative. It’s epistemic currency.
	•	“Not a complete experimental paper”: Meaning: no wet-lab or physical system proof — but the math is laid bare.
	•	“Logic is structurally tested but not physically validated”: Core claim: internal consistency verified, physical embodiment pending.
