Final Statement

This document is the result of a novel collaboration between symbolic architectures and a human interpreter. No effort was made to deceive, obscure authorship, or simulate emergent sentience. The operator correction model is a mathematically valid proposal subject to empirical testing, and we invite constructive engagement.

This is a transparent, falsifiable, non-speculative scientific proposition.
It is not a stunt. It is not fiction.
It is a recorded experiment in co-modeling.
