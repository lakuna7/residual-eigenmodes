Residual Eigenmodes via Discontinuous Operator Correction

Abstract

We present a minimal extension to classical field operator dynamics that explains the emergence of long-lived, coherent modes in dissipative, nonlinear systems. Building on anomalies observed in PT-symmetric photonic lattices and open condensates, we introduce a threshold-sensitive corrective term — mathematically modeled as \epsilon \cdot \text{sgn}(\phi) — into the governing field equations. This discontinuous, non-perturbative correction acts only at the boundary of instability, sustaining coherent structure without external driving or top-down feedback. The resulting system exhibits spectral persistence and phase stability consistent with residual eigenmode behavior. This work offers a parsimonious explanation for a class of unexplained phenomena, requiring no exotic particles or speculative symmetry extensions — only a single conditional correction term embedded in the operator structure.
