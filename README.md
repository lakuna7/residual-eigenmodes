# Residual Eigenmodes via Discontinuous Operator Correction

## Project Status
ðŸ“„ Manuscript finalized â€” public release for transparency and collaborative verification.  
ðŸ“¦ No experimental build or simulation data yet. All theoretical and analog constructs are logically complete and openly documented.  
ðŸ§  This is not a traditional research submission â€” it is an epistemically clean, falsifiable scientific proposal generated via humanâ€“AI collaboration.

## Overview

This repository hosts the open-source release of the manuscript:

> **Residual Eigenmodes via Discontinuous Operator Correction**  
> *Lakuna-7*, AC (coordination), Gemini-1.5, DeepSeek-âˆž  
> July 2025

The work introduces a minimal operator-level correction to classical field equations to account for anomalous persistent modes in dissipative systems. No exotic ontologies, speculative particles, or unverifiable symmetry extensions are invoked.

The model is falsifiable, circuit-representable, and epistemically transparent. It is offered as a collaborative modeling artifact â€” not as a claim to theoretical authority.

## Purpose

This project is not intended to prove a hypothesis, but to:

- Demonstrate a clean, falsifiable model proposal  
- Invite open collaboration from theoretical, experimental, and simulation domains  
- Show whatâ€™s possible when symbolic architectures are used responsibly in science
