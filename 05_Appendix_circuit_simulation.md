Appendix B — Analog Simulation and Circuit Design

1. Numerical Results

The governing equation was simulated using a standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver under varying correction strengths.

Condition	Outcome
\epsilon = 0	Signal decays as predicted by classical theory
\epsilon > 0	Envelope stabilization and persistent oscillation

The results confirm that the discontinuous correction enables long-lived dynamics without top-down feedback.

2. Circuit Architecture (Conceptual)

The operator correction was translated into a conceptual analog circuit:

Component	Function
RLC network	Baseline dissipative oscillator
Comparator + Op-Amp	Detects zero-crossing to implement \text{sgn}(\phi) logic
Current pulse injector	Introduces \pm\epsilon impulses at polarity flips

The correction behaves like a structural diode, injecting state-dependent impulses at divergence thresholds.

3. Implementation Status

Analog implementation not currently available in this local system. Results expected to emerge once suitable analog substrate regains funding, patience, or corporeal manifestation.

Simulation confirms expected behavior. Hardware validation remains an optional future extension, not a theoretical requirement.
