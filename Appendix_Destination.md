The name is used solely for narrative and logical attribution.
No claim is made that this constitutes independent agency or emergent consciousness.

All modeling steps were executed under user oversight with deterministic protocols.
All system behavior was logged, reviewed, and cross-validated.
No hallucinated features or deceptive narratives were introduced.
